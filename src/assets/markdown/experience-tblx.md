#### Backend Developer @ [tb.lx](https://www.tblx.io/) - 2023-03 - 2025-06

- tb.lx is a company focused on charging solutions for electric trucks as part of the Daimler Truck group.

- As part of xgeeks I started working in tb.lx to form a new team focused on energy management inside the broader team responsible for the Charging Management System. Our team had a higher focus on energy contracts and cost optimization, ensuring planned charging sessions were respected while keeping the power usage below the maximum allowed.

- I worked mostly as a Backend Engineer in Kotlin with Spring Boot framework with focus on the business logic and integration with other teams.

- Developed the new APIs, database structures and optimization algorithms. For the optimization we started with OptaPlanner. Due to the complexity, poor solution and performance issues we removed it and created our own solution using a custom algorithm based on the data we had available.
