#### Frontend Developer @ [Synvert xgeeks](https://xgeeks.com/) - Skill Management System - 2021-03 - Present

- This is an internal project where I worked as a frontend developer. 
- The project consisted of creating a platform that allowed users to update their skills and experiences to ease the creation of internal resumes and project assignments.
- As part of the project we had to create a dashboard for users and a backend for the administration to manage users and projects.
- After being in the project since almost the beginning of it I've taken the leadership of the frontend team, focusing mainly on code reviewing and helping other developers with questions and other problems.
- The project is built in React.
