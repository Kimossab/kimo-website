### About me

My name is Lu√≠s Pereira, also known as Kimossab. I'm a {{var:age}} years old software engineer from Portugal.  

I've been working as a full-stack engineer ever since I finished Bachelor's Degree of Informatics Engineering in [IPV](https://www.estgv.ipv.pt/estgv/) in 2013.  

My hobbies are programming, playing video games, watching anime and reading Light Novels. I also enjoy playing around with electronics and home automation DIY projects.

I don't shy away from working with new technologies and I love to learn new things. Even without experience in a specific language or framework I adapt quickly and my experience from other languages helps me to tackle new challenges.
