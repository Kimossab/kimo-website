# About me

Hello and welcome to my website. My name is Lu√≠s Pereira, also known in the internet as Kimossab.  
I'm a {{age}} years old programmer from Portugal.  

I've been working as a full-stack developer ever since I finished Bachelor's Degree of Informatics Engineering in [IPV](https://www.estgv.ipv.pt/estgv/).  

My hobbies are programming, playing video games, watching anime and reading Light Novels.  
I really enjoy creating stuff and learning how things work through trial and error, just like my discord bot and this webpage.
