We can search for the source of images, both artwork or anime screenshots.  
This is split into 2, one for art and the other for anime, they make use of the context menu of messages to make it easier to search for a specific image.  

As such, there's no chat commands, they all go through going into the context menu of an image (right click on desktop or press and hold on mobile).
