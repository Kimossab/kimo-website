Other miscellaneous commands that don't have a specific category. Mostly commands just for fun.

- **/misc group [groups] [values]** - Command to create random groups. The `groups` parameter is the amount of groups to create, and the `values` parameter is the values to be grouped. `values` should be a string of values separated by ` | `.
- **/misc donut [a?] [b?]** - Creates a donut in ascii. The `a` and `b` are optional parameters to indicate the angles in radians of the perspective of the donut. If none are given they will be random.
