### Discord Bot

This is a Discord bot that I created from scratch. The main objective of this bot was for me to practice my skills in Node, socket and third party communication.

The bot has had a lot of iterations along the way, some features were added and others removed. It started as an helper in managing my friends' servers, but it has evolved into a more simple and generic bot whose main purpose right now is to alert me and my friends about when new anime episodes air.  

It's a still a great playground for me to test new features and ideas.

The bot is written in Typescript. [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Kimossab/kimoo-disc-bot)
