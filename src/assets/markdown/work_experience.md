Work as contractor for other companies as well as internal projects.  
Projects I've been involved in:

[tb.lx](https://www.tblx.io/) - <sub>2023-03 - Present</sub>

- Joined tb.lx as part of a new team focused on the management of energy in each charing depot in order to optimize the costs and efficiency of each charing station and vehicle.
  Worked as a Backend Engineer in Kotlin with Spring Boot framework.

[WTX](https://wtx.com/) - <sub>2023-01 - 2023-03</sub>

- WTX is a company focused on a B2B marketplace for used trucks.  
  Joined as part of the "Automation" team, which was responsible mostly for the backend and backoffice of the application. My main role was backend developer, but helped with the frontend when required.  
  The project is built in Nest with Typescript.

[Cazoo](https://www.cazoo.com) - <sub>2021-08 - 2022-12</sub>

- In cazoo I worked as part of the Car Care team, which was the team responsible for the extras in a purchase of car (extended warranty, insurance, service plans, etc.). Our team had a lot of different responsibilities, from the frontend to the backend. The last 4 months I switched to the Order Management team which was a team focused on backend to manage and store orders relevant data.
- The backend was built as microservices and the frontend as micro frontend. Everything was hosted from AWS, and managed by serverless and terraform. The MFE were all in React while the host webpage was Next. The backend was lambda functions in Node with Typescript.
- As part of these teams I was involved in all the processes of the teams, from infrastructure, which included moving from CircleCI to Github Actions, to AWS management, OpsGenie alerts, Kibana/Datadog monitoring dashboards and frontend/backend developments.
- As the project was divided in multiple teams, each with a very specific focus, and our initiatives always impacted other teams, I've been involved alongside the rest of the team in plannings and inter team communications and contract negotiations.

[Skill Management System](#) - <sub>2021-03 - Present</sub>

- This is an internal project where I worked as a front end developer. After being in the project since almost the beginning of it I've taken the leadership of the frontend team, focusing mainly on code reviewing and helping other developers with questions and other problems.  
  The project is built in React.
