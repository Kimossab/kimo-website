#### Software Engineer @ [Synvert xgeeks](https://xgeeks.com/) - 2021-03 - Present

Since March 2021, I have been working as a contractor for various companies through xgeeks, currently part of Synvert group. My role has primarily been as a full-stack developer, but I have also taken on specific roles such as backend developer and frontend developer depending on the project requirements.  
Those projects, including tb.lx, WTX, Cazoo, and Tamanna, where I contributed to both backend and frontend development. 
In addition to client projects, I have also worked on internal projects such as the Skill Management System, where I took on a leadership role in the frontend team, focusing on code reviews and mentoring other developers.
