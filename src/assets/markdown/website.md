This is the website you're currently visiting. It's my playground for web related things, it includes the webpage and a backend.  
Both are made using typescript.

The frontend is done in Vue.JS, while the backend is a REST application using Express. Everything is being served through nginx.  
I have plans to improve the backend more and test other frameworks.

The backend is not only used by the frontend and might have other use cases for other personal projects. It's also used to update these projects running in the server.
